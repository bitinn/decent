Job queue is hard, so we try Disneyâ„¢ queue instead. (use Redis; WIP)


# Motivation

Despite efforts and inputs from brilliant developers, a fault-tolerant job queue with Node.js & Redis is still somewhat of a mythical beast. And no wonder: Redis isn't a queueing system by nature and Node.js isn't known for its error handling.

In short, we need to lay better building blocks on top of Node and Redis, before we can get to the magical queueing.

Let `dq` handles the groundwork, so you can enjoy the power of queues.
